## User Story

```md
AS A social media startup
I WANT an API for my social network that uses a NoSQL database
SO THAT my website can handle large amounts of unstructured data
```

## Acceptance Criteria

```md
GIVEN a social network API
WHEN I enter the command to invoke the application
THEN my server is started and the Mongoose models are synced to the MongoDB database
WHEN I open API GET routes in Insomnia for users and thoughts
THEN the data for each of these routes is displayed in a formatted JSON
WHEN I test API POST, PUT, and DELETE routes in Insomnia
THEN I am able to successfully create, update, and delete users and thoughts in my database
WHEN I test API POST and DELETE routes in Insomnia
THEN I am able to successfully create and delete reactions to thoughts and add and remove friends to a userâ€™s friend list
```


### API Routes

**`/api/users`** 
* `GET` all users
* `GET` a single user by its `_id` and populated thought and friend data
* `POST` a new user:
```json
// example data
{
  "username": "lernantino",
  "email": "lernantino@gmail.com"
}
```
* `PUT` to update a user by its `_id`
* `DELETE` to remove user by its `_id`
**BONUS**: Remove a user's associated thoughts when deleted.

---

**`/api/users/:userId/friends/:friendId`**
* `POST` to add a new friend to a user's friend list
* `DELETE` to remove a friend from a user's friend list

---

**`/api/thoughts`**
* `GET` to get all thoughts
* `GET` to get a single thought by its `_id`
* `POST` to create a new thought (don't forget to push the created thought's `_id` to the associated user's `thoughts` array field)
```json
// example data
{
  "thoughtText": "Here's a cool thought...",
  "username": "lernantino",
  "userId": "5edff358a0fcb779aa7b118b"
}
```

## Installation

Initialize npm to produce the package.json file.
Type npm install to install the following: MongoDB, mongoose, express, dotenv, luxon.
 
In the command line, type npm start.
USES Insomnia to perform CRUD tasks


## Usage
- JavaScript with Node.js - base coding language
- express - to create the routers/endpoints
- dotenv - to hide the environmental variables (password/database)
- MongoDB package - as the database dialect
- mongoose - to interpret the database commands
- Insomnia app - to perform the CRUD functions to the database 

## Credits

I would like to thank my tutoring for helping me. (Though seeding gave me lots of trouble and I only seeded Users successfully. I want to look into npm mongo-seeding more.)
